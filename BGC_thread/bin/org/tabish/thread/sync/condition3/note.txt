if method is synchronised and static

3 thread call this method
what happen will other 2 thread will make entry to static synchronised method? 

ans: no other thread will not make entry to this static synchronised method 
       i.e   lock is maintain on class also.(in case of static method) 
 






4th condition:
                if we call static method with class name        Shared.show()
                                          and object also        new Thread1.show();
                does it make entry to method because two lock is there????????

ans:
it will not make entry because 
in case of STATIC LOCK IS CHECKED ON CLASS ONLY
